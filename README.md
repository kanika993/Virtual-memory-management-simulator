## Virtual-memory-management-simulator
Developed a web-based Virtual Memory Management Simulator as an educational tool to demonstrate the working of memory management concepts in Operating Systems. The simulator features a clean, multi-page website with dynamic and interactive modules designed for students and learners.


## ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- *Hero Page*: Introductory landing page explaining the simulator's purpose.
- *Login Page*: Simple authentication page to access the dashboard.
- *Dashboard*: Navigation panel linking to theory, algorithms, and simulator.
- *Theory Section*: Detailed explanations of virtual memory concepts like Paging, Segmentation, and Page Replacement.
- *Algorithms Page*: Explanation of algorithms like FIFO, LRU, and Optimal.
- *Run Page*: Allows users to input custom values and select algorithms for simulation.
